Oh, well then you want the VB macros, let me check for those to see if I still have them. Ah yes, here's the basic approach:

 

Dedicate a workstation running Excel 2013 to the reporting update process
Save the file as “Macro enabled workbook” (.xlsm)
Enable the Developer tab, go into VB and paste the following code (or equivalent)


Sub Auto_Open()

Application.Wait (Now + TimeValue("00:00:10")) ' Allow 10 seconds to cancel when opened so we can edit if necessary

Application.DisplayAlerts = False ' Disable prompts for saving over existing files, etc.

strPath = "C:\temp\Book1.xlsx" ' Set path to saved xlsx file

ThisWorkbook.RefreshAll ' Refresh the data model

ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs strPath, xlOpenXMLWorkbook ' Save xlsm file to xlsx file

Application.Quit ' Quit application

End Sub

 

What this code does is that when the Excel file is opened, it refreshes all data connections and saves the workbook as a “.xlsx” file (not macro enabled).

Create a scheduled task on the dedicated workstation to open the Excel file at a set interval
Based upon the previous set interval, schedule a second task to allow enough time for the data model to refresh and the file to close. This second task copies the .xlsx file to the document repository. There are a number of methods available to achieve this including mapping a drive to the document library and performing a simple copy, etc.
 

The above is copy paste from an approach document that I wrote and we successfully implemented, I forget the details around it but you could replace the saving as XLSX file to whatever export you want.

 

Please understand, this is a REALLY hacky approach as this was never an intended use for Excel. I only ever use this when forced to by circumstance and it is never a "recommended" option. I would hold to my recommendation to sign-up for Power BI Service, Connect your Excel spreadsheets and allow it to do the refreshes, they should work with Power Query queries no problem. On the automated export side, I don't really have a solution for you.
